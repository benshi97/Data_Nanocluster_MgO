## Paper abstract

Metal nanoclusters supported on oxide surfaces are widely-used catalysts that boast sharply enhanced activity over bulk metal catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations have been pivotal towards advancing our understanding of (bulk) heterogeneous catalysis, but the delicate interplay of metal-metal and metal-support interactions in supported nanoclusters has posed challenges for DFT. Indeed, in some cases, changing DFT models (exchange-correlation functional and dispersion correction) can even give qualitatively different predictions. Coupled cluster theory [specifically CCSD(T)] is the `gold-standard' simulation technique that provides reliable predictions, but its steep computational cost has hindered its application to supported nanoclusters. In this work, we leverage recent advances to report CCSD(T)-quality benchmarks for oxide supported nanoclusters, focusing on the prototypical coinage metals on MgO. Comparisons with a broad range of DFT models reveal that none of the investigated models can accurately describe the examined systems. We demonstrate that this primarily arises from an inadequate account of metal-metal interactions in the nanocluster and propose a high-level correction that reaches CCSD(T) accuracy at low computational cost. This forges a path towards studying larger systems, which we highlight by tackling Au<sub>20</sub> on MgO; a challenging system where DFT models have disagreed on its ground state structure.
